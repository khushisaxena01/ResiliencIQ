# ResiliencIQ - Web Application for Global Risk Compliance and Supply Chain Intelligence (OpenAI Academy x NxtWave Buildathon)

### 1. Introduction
ResiliencIQ is a web-based platform designed to provide predictive risk intelligence, compliance monitoring, and supply chain simulation. The goal is to deliver an enterprise-grade yet accessible solution that empowers decision-makers, SMEs, and regulators to proactively identify vulnerabilities, simulate “what-if” scenarios, and optimize operations. Unlike traditional dashboards that only display descriptive analytics, ResiliencIQ combines real-time data streams, AI-driven forecasting, interactive simulation models, and OpenAI-powered endpoints via OpenAPI to provide actionable intelligence, enabling intelligent responses to real-time scenarios.

### 2. Problem Statement
In today’s volatile global environment, organizations face simultaneous challenges:
- Supply Chain Fragility: Global supply chains are deeply interconnected, yet disruptions (wars, sanctions, pandemics, port closures) cascade unpredictably.
- Compliance Complexity: Enterprises struggle with GDPR, CCPA, and cross-border compliance, with little visibility into how data flows across internal systems.
- SME Inefficiency: Small businesses face huge losses due to understocking/overstocking, lacking tools to forecast demand intelligently.

Current solutions exist in silos — supply chain dashboards, compliance tools, or SME SaaS apps. ResiliencIQ’s unique proposition is to unify all three dimensions into one intelligent, Spark-powered web application, while enabling constructive AI interactions via OpenAPI and OpenAI integration to simulate realistic risk, compliance, and inventory scenarios.

### 3. Why This Idea is Unique
Unified Risk Lens: Integrates compliance, supply chain, and SME forecasting into one holistic platform.
Simulation Capability: Users can test “shock” scenarios (e.g., currency collapse, supplier bankruptcy) and visualize cascading impacts.
Graph + AI Fusion: Combines GraphX modeling with MLlib predictive forecasting and OpenAI-based scenario reasoning for actionable insights.

Multi-Stakeholder Value:

- Executives → Stress-test business continuity.
- Compliance officers → Detect data lineage issues in real time.
- SMEs → Optimize inventory with AI.
- Cloud-Native Web App: Browser-accessible, lightweight, globally deployable.
- Backend Complexity for Resilience: Flask handles AI/ML pipelines and Spark integration, Express.js manages API orchestration, authentication, and real-time pipelines.
- Advanced Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (Admin, Analyst, SME), encrypted sessions.
- OpenAPI + OpenAI Integration: Exposes interactive endpoints where users can query predictive analytics, simulate compliance shocks, or forecast inventory using OpenAI reasoning. Essential for hackathon demonstration, allows judges and users to test and interact with the system live.

### 4. Core Modules
